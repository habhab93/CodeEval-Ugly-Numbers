CodeEval-Ugly-Numbers
=====================

Completed challenge as described here: https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/42/ as part of the Peanut Labs application process.

This is also apparently an old Google Code Jam problem. Interesting..

-----

Most recent version fixed overflow error for variables in method isUgly by changing them to primitive type long. This had prevented the mod operators in the return statement from working properly, and thus I had received a score of 95 instead of the full 100.  

CodeEval's staff is telling me that I can use 4 times less memory in my solution, so that will be something to work on.
